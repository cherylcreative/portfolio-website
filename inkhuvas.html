          <h3>The Brief</h3>
          <p>Through my UX Design course at CareerFoundry, this is a project I’ve accomplished to showcase my understanding and application of UX processes, concepts and methods.</p>

              <div>
                <h3>Problem statement</h3>
                <p>According to the research previously done: 17% of people who had tattoo did not make the right decision due to impulsiveness, poor choice in tattoo artist and lack of certainty in the design, which resulted in the regrets of having the tattoo.</p>
                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>People who wants to get a tattoo need a platform in which they can browse for inspiration, review tattoo artists’ profiles, have online consultations, and rationally decide on a meaningful design before getting a tattoo. We will know this to be true when we see less than 17% of people regret their tattoo designs when booked through the app.</p>
              </div>
              <!-- Stage 2 -->
              <div>
                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <h3>Agenda</h3>
                <p>To assess the current market and understand what the target audience needs, a competitive analysis was conducted on direct competitors namely, Tattoodo and Inkhunter.</p>
                <h3>Insights</h3>
                <p>The key information to takeaway lies in the SWOT profiles briefly shown below. Out of the two competitors, Tattoodo stands out more and has more insights to learn from. Both a native app and web application, they emerge with the strongest market position due to its strong social media and press presence. Their abundant database profile - a large community of users and network of tattoo lovers and artists, grown over the years had them claiming its title of World’s #1 Tattoo community.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Inkhunter, a native app, has a mobile-first approach and was the first to introduce Augmented Reality (AR). However, their UX lack usability, functionality and reliability. The lack of database is also another cause that weakens their market value.</p>

                <h3>Agenda</h3>
                <p>To conduct User Surveys on two main demographic groups: Prospective Tattoo Seeker (no tattoos yet) and Tattoo Enthusiast, to gather quantitative data.</p>
                <p>To conduct User Interviews on the above demographics for qualitative data and a Tattoo artist for a new perspective of how the app may benefit them too.</p>
                <p>To analyse the user research findings and generate insights with affinity mapping.</p>

                <p>The goal of this test is to assess the learnability for new users when interacting with it for the first time. I would like to observe and measure if the users understand the app, whether they are able to navigate through the app and complete the tasks which are the core features such as saving image to board, requesting an appointment by sharing tattoo plan with artist and lastly booking an appointment.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <div>
                  <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                  <p>I did create a platform in which users can browse for inspiration, have online consultations but I had missed out creating screens for users to review artists’ profiles for the MVP.</p>
                  <h3>Validation</h3>
                  <p>Through research and testing with potential users, feedback can be gathered on how we are able to improve the web app. This will be a cycle by conducting more research and testing our iterations again.</p>
                  <h3>Improvements</h3>
                  <p>Create more screens to clarify the validity of artists’ profiles. It is relatively confusing as to why users have to send a tattoo plan to artists before booking an appointment. That flow of explanation can be improved.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3>User Testing</h3>
                  <p>For future testings, it’ll be focused on user task flows. Usability tests such as first click tests and five second tests. A/B testing sessions would be helpful to modify and optimise small changes.</p>
                  <h3>Timeline</h3>
                  <p>Create new user flows for other tasks and go through the entire design process till high-fidelity prototypes. Conduct more rounds of usability testings, improve on future iterations based on the feedbacks and insights.</p>
